## **How it works?**

Firstly, the stories/posts from various sites like Reddit, Creepasta, Literotica, TruthorFiction and other sites are scraped with the help of the web scraper. The raw data is then fed into the backend which parses it into valid Markdown & saves it to the Supabase database. Finally using React in the frontend parsed data is displayed with additional features.
